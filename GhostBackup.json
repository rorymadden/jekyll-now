Volkswagen expects their first self driving cars on the market by 2019, Ford in 2020 and BMW by 2021. At the Frankfurt Auto show last month, US secretary of transportation [Anthony Foxx said](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34475031) he expects driverless cars to be in use all over the world in 10 years. Meaning in 10 years from now we will be in the process of phasing out human driven cars. \n\n**Getting Everywhere in Few Minutes**\n![Hyperloop](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/55dfdd71e4b0eeba87720aad/t/56ca839e8259b508f2dd39b9/1456112743282/CarnegieMellonHyperloop_Pod1.png?format=2500w)\n\nFor decades, we’ve been trying to eliminate barriers of time and distance. With technology moving forward so quickly, we are very close to a super-fast and super-efficient transportation system which will be capable of whisking passengers between cities (and even nations) just in few minutes. Let’s all cross our fingers and hope that Hyperloop is not only a science fiction, but rather a real part of our future.\n\n**Expanding our Reality**\n![VR](http://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ps-vr.jpg)\n\nThere is nothing we could agree more with Mark Zuckerberg than with the idea of being able to expand our reality even more than today. In ten years from now, virtual reality will fool all of our senses, and bring us into truly immersive experiences. Augmented reality is expected to span numerous sectors, from healthcare, architecture, design, e-commerce, tourism to education. The potential possibilities and business opportunities of VR and AR are literally endless. A completely different world will be in the palm of our hands.\n\n**Internet Access Everywhere**\n![ProjectLoon](http://www.designboom.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/google-project-loon-designboom00.jpg)\n\nVery ambitious plan (but definitely worthy of respect) is to make the internet accessible to everyone. In 10 years Billions of people will get online thanks to projects like [Google’s ‘Project Loon’](https://www.google.com/loon) based on high-altitude balloons or [Facebook’s ‘Aquila’](https://code.facebook.com/posts/993520160679028/building-communications-networks-in-the-stratosphere/) project with drones. This will finally see the rise of developing nations, remote regions and those suppressed by war and bureaucracy. Hooray for the internet everywhere!\n\n**3D Printing of Everything**\n![3D-Print](http://www.hzpadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3dprinting.jpg)\n\n3D printing technology continues to grow and promises to revolutionise many industry sectors. In the advanced stages of this remarkable technology we should be able to print almost anything we can imagine – houses, cars, devices, clothes, furniture, planes, spacecrafts, or even artificial human organs.\n\n**Aerial Drone Services**\n![Drone](https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/drone.jpg?w=1024)\n\nWith a great hype of drones today, we can be sure about their presence in the future. With an industry estimated by [PwC](http://fortune.com/2016/05/09/here-comes-the-latest-drone-army/) as being worth over 127 billion, drones can be a game-changer for businesses, governments and even individuals. Whether it be for delivery services to remote surveillance, in ten years from now, there will be more man-made items in the sky than birds.\n\n**The Collision of Humans and Robots**\n![Exoskeleton](http://www.suitx.com/sites/default/files/images/content-section-images/exoskeleton3.JPG)\n\nIf we have robots which can serve you food or clean your house now, there is no doubt about robots assisting us in our future everyday life. Moreover, robotic systems are merging with parts of our bodies, so we’ve already started down the path towards a cyborg future. However, there is no need to be scared. Great inventions like robotic limbs or exoskeleton will positively affect lives of thousands of people with disabilities and injuries.\n\n**People on Mars**\n![RedDragon](https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOK4rI0jyiawakZdhVmqdbkzYF4=/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6396425/20802118724_6f84936ce3_o.0.jpg)\n\nThe latest and boldest of our predictions (you’d better finish your coffee now). Are you one of those who thought, “this is very far fetched,” when watching a movie Martian? Well, you might have been wrong. Elon Musk is also driving this futuristic effort as he edges closer to his life-long dream of colonising another planet as SpaceX’s mission [‘Red Dragon’](http://www.space.com/32718-spacex-red-dragon-private-mars-missions-pictures.html) is planned – it should depart Earth in 2024, and arrive on Mars in 2025.

To match this new demand, different design areas have come up: Web Design (2000), Responsive Design (2008), Experience Design (2015). With technology moving faster than ever, who knows where the next years will take us. We've put together a list of the design jobs which will influence our future the most.\n\n####Return of Industrial Design\n![3D-Printing](/content/images/2016/08/3Dprinting.jpg)\n\nThe industrial designer will make a comeback in two ways; \n\n***Advanced Experience Design (IoT)***\n\nProduct design is no longer about just designing a tangible product.

Is there even a need to mention the great hype of Pokémon Go? This trend is very likely to continue and we will need more and more people who know how to create a gateway to the new dimension.\n\n####Future DNA “Life” Designers\n![DNA](/content/images/2016/08/design-future-1.jpg)\n\nOur DNA will play an important role in our future, and it goes beyond the ‘designer babies’ concepts.

Brandtone is a leading mobile marketing and engagement specialist working with companies like Unilever, Pepsico, OMO, Knorr and many more so Butler has plenty of experience in developing world-class processes for product development.\n\nThe three facets, while seemingly independent, are closely related. Efficient product processes which reduce unnecessary overheads when supported by senior management, lead to increased team motivation. Butler breaks down the key stages to implementing an efficient product process into short term (Scrum), medium term (Agile) and long term (Lean) goals.\n\n####Scrum\nButler discusses that when he first started out in the area, Scrum was an easy-to-implement system for short term success. Scrum is an Agile project management methodology which timeboxes pieces of development and delivers iterative working software based on the highest priority features.\n\nButler had happy teams who were highly motivated with high company buy-in on the project. As a result the output was reliable and predictable. UX was also incorporated into the equation which lead to happy customers and users. \n\nHowever, it wasn’t enough. According to Butler *“Scrum alone isn't going to make your product successful”*. This is where he moves the discussion towards Lean and Agile and how more companies, such as Brandtone, are adopting these processes. \n\n####Agile\nWhile Scrum is an Agile methodology implementing Scrum does not make a company Agile; this is down to the culture of the company. According to Butler, the Agile culture is pervasive in software development teams as a best practice process to develop great products and improve release cycles. \n\nAgile as a culture favours working software over documentation, people and interaction over processes, communication over contracts and responding to change over planning. The last point is the most difficult for companies to adopt - the agility to change means that timelines are relegated and work is done based on the highest priority. The core assumption of the approach, borne out through years of software development, is that teams don't know what they need to build at the start of a project and the sooner they get the software into the hands of the end users the quicker the learning can be. The famous line *“Your product won’t survive its first interaction with a customer”* implies that many of your key assumptions will prove false causing you to pivot the product to get the right product-market fit. Agile delivery lets you get your product out to customers earlier and react to the changes and feedback that come back. \n\nHowever there are a few caveats to Agile that Butler wanted to point out. \n\nAgile is often referred to as a culture instead of a process and this is due to the need for buy-in at all levels of the company. Butler references the famous **Chicken and Pig Restaurant** analogy. The chicken and the pig decide to open a restaurant. The restaurant will serve ‘ham and eggs with each of them providing the food. This highlights a key difference in stakeholder engagement: the chicken is involved whereas the pig is really committed! Butler points out that *“if you don’t have agile adoption from the CEO down, it’s not going to work. It shouldn’t be up to the development team to drive organisational change”*. The “pig” companies succeed and the “chickens” do not!\n\nAdditionally, with agile there is a risk that due to the immediate feedback teams can waste time focussing in the wrong direction for the product. According to Butler, *“there is often too much focus on developing new features that nobody uses”*, adding that *“there is nothing in the scrum manifesto to help you in the long-term”*. He lists off the usual suspects like Google Buzz and Google Wave which met the expectations of their technical beta testers but failed to solve real world problems.\n\n####When Scrum and Agile Are Not Enough… Use Lean\nLean comes from Lean Manufacturing and is a set of principles for achieving quality, speed & customer alignment. The core principle of Lean is to relentlessly eliminate waste, with waste being defined as anything that isn’t adding value. Teams should only work on what they absolutely need to be doing at this moment in time. But this is not as straightforward as it may seem. \n\nEliminating waste is tied closely to a complementary goal of optimising the whole. There is a temptation to focus on optimising a particular area, often it's where the person has most experience. But optimising one area over others can actually be more detrimental to overall productivity. To optimise a process you need to identify the bottlenecks and optimise for these. In software development, like in manufacturing, the bottlenecks tend not to be in a particular process but in the handovers between processes. By reducing bottlenecks you can decrease the overall time it takes to get something for the start of a process to the end, which, in software terms, is the time from capturing requirements to getting working software in front of your users.\n\nButler outlines three practical steps that companies can take to transition towards lean:\n\n**1) Set up cross functional teams**\n\nMost organisations operate in traditional functional silos - marketing, design, development, testing etc. It is essential that different functional experts work and, ideally sit together when they are working on the same product or goal. A secondary benefit of cross functional teams is that they can see the big picture better and ensure that the product vision is being followed. \n\n***Goal:*** *Eliminate the bottlenecks of handovers and the waste of mis-communication and ensure that the product vision is adhered to.*\n\n**2) Give autonomy but track quality**\n\nMicromanagement is a bottleneck. You need to respect that the people doing the work are the ones that best know how to do it. Give them what they need to be effective and then trust them to do it. While you shouldn’t dictate how something is done you must ensure that the output is always of production quality. This follows the saying ‘what gets measured gets done’ as opposed to ‘what gets managed gets done’. \n\n***Goal:*** *Facilitate quick delivery while minimising the waste of defects which delay product release and customer feedback.*\n\n**3) Share and Collaborate**\n\nCompanies need to ensure consistency across products both in terms of design and interoperability. Cross Functional Teams present challenges to the traditional management approvals and reviews which were implemented to ensure consistency. Therefore in a lean organisation transparency is key. Teams should use wikis, shared documents and shared calendars or lunch sessions among other option. Any method of knowledge sharing should be encouraged.\n\n***Goal:*** *Ensure consistency in a fragmented world.*\n\n>“Organizations that are truly lean have a strong competitive advantage because they respond very rapidly and in a highly disciplined manner to market demand, rather than try to predict the future.” – Mary Poppendieck\n\n####The League Tables in Productivity\n\nIn summary, a company’s ability to react to customer needs is becoming a significant competitive advantage. The companies who are winning in this space are not implementing new procedures on top of the existing structure but, rather, changing the structure and culture of the company from the inside out. Like changing the course of a cargo ship these things take time - and significant management buy in. While there is no “one true way” to implement this transition, by following the steps outlined by Butler above companies can begin their journey. To recap:\n\n**1)** Scrum can help product teams take advantage of the communication and learning benefits of agile\n\n**2)** The agile culture helps to support product teams to deliver the most pressing requirements versus strictly adhering to plans and timelines. \n\n**3)** And Lean helps companies speed up their release cycles so that they can get products and features in front of their customers quicker. \n\nGiven buy-in is that starting point for this journey the final question remains to ask yourself: Am I a Pig, or a Chicken?\n\n*Got any other processes you use like Kanba or anything that’s worked?

This week we take a look at the developer world and the top 10 developer jobs you need to prepare for in the future.\n\nAs technologies emerge at warp speed, there is no doubt developer jobs will stay in high demand in the next few decades. Entrepreneurs across the world are trying to transform the world but this won’t be possible without brilliant developers building the products. What are the key technology areas that will rock the future and what should your next career step look like? Here are 10 predictions to future-proof your developer career:\n\n###1) Javascript Developers\n>*“Software is eating the world, the web is eating software, and JavaScript rules the web.”* Eric Elliott\n\n<a href=\"https://openclipart.org/detail/214902/javascript-file\"></a> With the advent of [universal](http://https://medium.com/@mjackson/universal-javascript-4761051b7ae9#.g8edt9aoj), [progressive](http://addyosmani.com/blog/getting-started-with-progressive-web-apps) web-apps the holy grail of write once run everywhere applications is starting to appear. On top of this React Native is showing that the same code can be run on the web, ios or android. While Javascript is derided by many, its popularity, and maturing ecosystem, mean it is becoming a go-to language. As far as the future goes, the one guarantee is that there will be a new framework and every company will be looking for developers with that skill set. The cycle has repeated from jQuery to Backbone to Angular to React to The Next Big Thing! Maybe you know the answer and will become the one who will write the new and shiny framework.\n\n###2) Full Stack Developers\nUXDX is all about the merging of UX and DX (developer experience) skills and one constant in technology over the past few decades is the ability to build of complex projects with less people. These days the  focus has been on multidisciplinary developers and the trend is only going to keep growing. As part of a lean team, developers are expected to be able to help out at any level of the stack in order to remove the bottlenecks of handovers. In future the demands are only going to increase with a large number of companies are already looking for full stack developers with UX experience. \n\n###3) Data scientist\nData scientists requires a mixture of multidisciplinary skills ranging from mathematics, computer science, statistics, and even business. The industry refers to Data Scientists as “unicorns” for their rarity, but the demand in this field is increasing. In fact, the area of Big Data is growing above 50% annually and there will be need to find optimal solutions to lot of problems lying ahead. Technology and tooling will reduce the barrier to entry but honing up on your mathematics won’t hurt. \n\n![alt](/content/images/2016/08/Devops-svg.png)\n###4) DevOps Engineer\nDevOps has already gathered huge support with even non-traditional companies getting on the bandwagon (link to Christian McHugh Interview). The promise of frequent deployments, or even up to hundreds of deployments per day (link to Intercom interview), is that companies can get products in front of their customers quickly and shorten the learning cycle. Successful DevOps Engineers will need to possess a combination of automation, coding, business, organisational, and interpersonal skills to make lives of fellow software development engineers easier. If you are already moving towards this area, you’re heading for a bright future.\n\n###5) Cloud Development Engineer\nCloud computing saves a lot of time and hassle - with the effect that operations departments are shrinking rapidly in many companies. However cloud computing does not solve all of the problems that traditional operations departments managed. Cloud engineers will be expected to support product teams by providing guidance on the range of services on offer, including new services like [server-less computing](http://www.networkworld.com/article/3053111/cloud-computing/what-is-amazon-cloud-s-lambda-and-why-is-it-a-big-deal.html), as well as managing authentication and governance to ensure that that the company remains secure and compliant with necessary regulatory bodies. As more companies look to reap the benefits of cloud computing the demand for professionals with cloud management skills is expected to rise exponentially. \n\n###6) Security engineer\nThe spotlight on security and the increasingly malicious nature of cyberattacks have created new opportunities for IT heroes who try to protect companies in a constantly changing ecosystem. From Whatsapp end-to-end encryption we use every day to quantum computing cryptography we will most likely need in the future, cybersecurity is becoming one of the hottest areas to work in.\n\n###7) IoT Developer\nDid you know that we are shooting for [10 million Internet of Things developers by 2020](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-10-million-developers-are-lining-up-for-the-internet-of-things)? If this number is even remotely accurate, then you want to put yourself in the best position possible to benefit from this IoT boom. Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, who are leading the space for connected intelligence, says “there is a rapidly growing role for technology that is at once transformative, unprecedented and accessible.” From smart gadgets to smart cities, be the talent driving it. \n\n###8) Distributed System Architect \nDistributed systems are a growing branch of software development popularised by Netflix and its [chaos monkey](http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html). Distributed systems encompass everything from distributed (micro)services to distributed databases to delegated proof networks such as Blockchain (the technology created to support bitcoin). Distributed computing skills have been recently selected as [no.1 on LinkedIn’s top job skills](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedins-top-25-skills-get-hired-2016-rahul-ambulkar), and there is no doubt this area is poised for even more rapid growth.\n\n![alt](/content/images/2016/08/ARDeveloper.jpg)\n###9) VR/AR Developer\nIf you want to build the future of gaming, entertainment, storytelling, education, or even health care, look no further. The current limited possibilities of virtual and augmented reality will become limitless in the future and you shouldn’t miss the opportunity to be at the heart of it.\n\n###10) AI/Machine Learning Developer\nWhether AI will herald the [end of the world](http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837566/elon-musk-one-ai-company-that-worries-me), or will [end all of the world's problems](http://www.kurzweilai.net/dont-fear-artificial-intelligence-by-ray-kurzweil) is up for debate. But what is not up for debate is that investment will continue in all things AI. Machine learning skill sets are growing in demand and will keep continuing. And this could be the safest bet - a good AI could probably replace all of the jobs above anyway!\n\nWith the tech world changing so fast, it’s really challenging to predict the future.

As far as the future goes, the one guarantee is that there will be a new framework and every company will be looking for developers with that skill set. The cycle has repeated from jQuery to Backbone to Angular to React to The Next Big Thing! Maybe you know the answer and will become the one who will write the new and shiny framework.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2fullstackdevelopers\">2) Full Stack Developers</h3>\n\n<p>UXDX is all about the merging of UX and DX (developer experience) skills and one constant in technology over the past few decades is the ability to build of complex projects with less people. These days the  focus has been on multidisciplinary developers and the trend is only going to keep growing. As part of a lean team, developers are expected to be able to help out at any level of the stack in order to remove the bottlenecks of handovers. In future the demands are only going to increase with a large number of companies are already looking for full stack developers with UX experience. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"3datascientist\">3) Data scientist</h3>\n\n<p>Data scientists requires a mixture of multidisciplinary skills ranging from mathematics, computer science, statistics, and even business. The industry refers to Data Scientists as “unicorns” for their rarity, but the demand in this field is increasing. In fact, the area of Big Data is growing above 50% annually and there will be need to find optimal solutions to lot of problems lying ahead. Technology and tooling will reduce the barrier to entry but honing up on your mathematics won’t hurt. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/08/Devops-svg.png\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4devopsengineer\">4) DevOps Engineer</h3>\n\n<p>DevOps has already gathered huge support with even non-traditional companies getting on the bandwagon (link to Christian McHugh Interview). The promise of frequent deployments, or even up to hundreds of deployments per day (link to Intercom interview), is that companies can get products in front of their customers quickly and shorten the learning cycle. Successful DevOps Engineers will need to possess a combination of automation, coding, business, organisational, and interpersonal skills to make lives of fellow software development engineers easier. If you are already moving towards this area, you’re heading for a bright future.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5clouddevelopmentengineer\">5) Cloud Development Engineer</h3>\n\n<p>Cloud computing saves a lot of time and hassle - with the effect that operations departments are shrinking rapidly in many companies. However cloud computing does not solve all of the problems that traditional operations departments managed. Cloud engineers will be expected to support product teams by providing guidance on the range of services on offer, including new services like <a href=\"http://www.networkworld.com/article/3053111/cloud-computing/what-is-amazon-cloud-s-lambda-and-why-is-it-a-big-deal.html\">server-less computing</a>, as well as managing authentication and governance to ensure that that the company remains secure and compliant with necessary regulatory bodies. As more companies look to reap the benefits of cloud computing the demand for professionals with cloud management skills is expected to rise exponentially. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"6securityengineer\">6) Security engineer</h3>\n\n<p>The spotlight on security and the increasingly malicious nature of cyberattacks have created new opportunities for IT heroes who try to protect companies in a constantly changing ecosystem. From Whatsapp end-to-end encryption we use every day to quantum computing cryptography we will most likely need in the future, cybersecurity is becoming one of the hottest areas to work in.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"7iotdeveloper\">7) IoT Developer</h3>\n\n<p>Did you know that we are shooting for <a href=\"http://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-10-million-developers-are-lining-up-for-the-internet-of-things\">10 million Internet of Things developers by 2020</a>? If this number is even remotely accurate, then you want to put yourself in the best position possible to benefit from this IoT boom. Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, who are leading the space for connected intelligence, says “there is a rapidly growing role for technology that is at once transformative, unprecedented and accessible.” From smart gadgets to smart cities, be the talent driving it. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"8distributedsystemarchitect\">8) Distributed System Architect</h3>\n\n<p>Distributed systems are a growing branch of software development popularised by Netflix and its <a href=\"http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html\">chaos monkey</a>. Distributed systems encompass everything from distributed (micro)services to distributed databases to delegated proof networks such as Blockchain (the technology created to support bitcoin). Distributed computing skills have been recently selected as <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedins-top-25-skills-get-hired-2016-rahul-ambulkar\">no.1 on LinkedIn’s top job skills</a>, and there is no doubt this area is poised for even more rapid growth.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/08/ARDeveloper.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"9vrardeveloper\">9) VR/AR Developer</h3>\n\n<p>If you want to build the future of gaming, entertainment, storytelling, education, or even health care, look no further. The current limited possibilities of virtual and augmented reality will become limitless in the future and you shouldn’t miss the opportunity to be at the heart of it.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"10aimachinelearningdeveloper\">10) AI/Machine Learning Developer</h3>\n\n<p>Whether AI will herald the <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837566/elon-musk-one-ai-company-that-worries-me\">end of the world</a>, or will <a href=\"http://www.kurzweilai.net/dont-fear-artificial-intelligence-by-ray-kurzweil\">end all of the world's problems</a> is up for debate. But what is not up for debate is that investment will continue in all things AI. Machine learning skill sets are growing in demand and will keep continuing. And this could be the safest bet - a good AI could probably replace all of the jobs above anyway!</p>\n\n<p>With the tech world changing so fast, it’s really challenging to predict the future.

What is the secret behind the product everyone loves and what can other industries learn from this amazing success story? We took a deep dive into their great work and found these useful tips to follow their success:\n\n###1. First Build a Great Team, Then Build a Great Product\nBefore you build your product - before you build anything - you need to build your team. It is one of the key factors that determine success or failure of the development process or the product itself. Think of your team as a mosaic. You’ve got all these separate pieces, each functional and capable in their own right, but it would have never been possible to create a full image without all of them working together. \n\nRiot Games is a great example - it was established in 2006 by a couple of entrepreneurial gamers in Los Angeles, and they've now reached 19 offices across the globe. To ensure worldwide success, they cross pollinated their team over the world, spreading their culture across the new locations, and let it grow naturally. If you still ask what is so fantastic about it, check the last years’ Fortune's lists \"[100 Best Companies to Work For](http://fortune.com/best-companies/riot-games-39/)\".\n\n###2. Never Stop Thinking of Your Customers\nPutting players before revenue, Riot Games has set a new standard on how video games should be made and maintained. It was one of the early games designed to allow free access to all the content. It’s still free-to-play and contains no ads or boxed copy sales and instead relies on microtransactions and other modes of revenue generation. This is a draw for many people as they don’t have to invest in a platform, pay for a download or a subscription. \n\nBy focusing on the needs of your customers and providing added value wherever you can, you are ensuring continued growth of their interest, loyalty, and in the end profitability of your own business as well.\n\n###3. Explore the Magic of Good User Experience\nOne of the reasons League of Legends has become so popular, is Riot Games’ focus on delivering an excellent player experience. It’s number one on their [manifesto](http://www.riotgames.com/riot-manifesto). However, this emphasis doesn’t mean only a constant focus on providing new, player friendly features, and attempts to keep the game engaging. There is another secret behind League of Legends that aligns with the Riot Games team mantra; the game is best played with a team, where players have to band together to defeat the enemy. What does this really mean in terms of the product success? That’s easy math: A happy gamer adds other friends which equals organic player growth.\n\nThe power of a connection works everywhere, inside and outside your product. Don’t forget that people are not alone out there and they will talk about your product. If you do things right, there is nothing to worry about. This is a path to your growing numbers.\n\n###4. Exploit the Power of Customer Feedback\nAlways listen to the users of your product. How do they feel using your product? What features do they really like? What do they recommend to improve? Follow their feedback and do your updates accordingly. \n\nGrowth of League of Legends has forced Riot Games to realise this is extremely important and they need to keep the dialog between developers and the community constantly open. They have found several ways for how to consolidate player reactions, like interaction with players in their forums or sharing “[Inside Design](http://www.riotgames.com/articles/20140910/243/rioters-talk-shop-about-upcoming-features)” developer diaries. With 27 million daily users, you can be sure there is always someone who will be happy to comment on your work.\n\n###5. Remember That Less Is Sometimes More\nInstead of churning out several games at the same time, Riot Games bet on one game, which has allowed their focus to ensure the success of a single product. With a continual improvement process, they’ve got a lot of learning on product development and user needs. Based on this experience, now they are more than ready to enter the door that League of Legends has opened for them. In the words of Travis George, Head of Product, EU at Riot Games: *'One of the things we get pulled up on is the fact that Riot Games is plural, with only one game. So a second game is obviously on the cards.'*\n\nAre you impressed by phenomenal success of Riot Games? Join us at UXDX in November and learn from the best.

The term has gained a lot of attention in a wide range of contexts, and has been embraced by organisations of all stripes - big and small corporations, NGOs and governments alike.\n\n####Design Thinking Interest: 2005 - Present\n\n![](/content/images/2016/08/design-thinking.PNG)\n\n###‘Failed Experiment’\n\nWith this rapid growth, criticism has also intensified. Bruce Nussbaum, who describes himself as one of design thinking’s biggest supporters, calls it a ‘failed experiment’. Others claim that design thinking has become a ‘buzz phrase’ that is hyped, over-used, and should be dismissed.\n\nDesign thinking has been declared *dead*.\n\n###Do We Really Need Design Thinking?\n\nIn a nutshell, design thinking is a user-centered way of problem solving that helps businesses (not necessarily working within the design industry) produce outstanding results. “Design thinking has become established as the way to build products, services and experiences with a focus on the people who use them. It’s the way that both startups and large corporations are fusing their work,” says Doug Powell, design principal at IBM. The design thinking process draws upon the logic and imagination of a designer, and encourages multi-disciplinary teams of designers, engineers, marketing, product managers, and many other to collaborate, and explore all possibilities how to reach a result that improves the lives of the users.\n\nIn fact, design thinking has produced thousands of success stories. It has helped non-design companies, both small and large, to start thinking in a new way and apply principles of design to foster innovation. Johnson & Johnson, P&G, GE, Uber, and IBM are only few examples of large companies that changed their mindsets and integrated design thinking throughout the entire business. They recognised the potential of design thinking, and found an alternative way to discover new opportunities, uncover issues and catalyse the process of solving problems. Using the mantra of IBM, design thinking helps them reach for ‘smarter teams, better ideas, and happier users’.\n\n###Everything’s Great, What’s the Problem?\nIf design thinking is delivering success then why are people claiming it should be dismissed or forgotten? The ‘death of design thinking’ lies less with the method itself than with the way it is being implemented. \n\nDesign thinking was established as a set of principles that guide how teams should focus more on the end users than on the product itself. However principles are hard to implement. As design thinking was being adopted at a large scale rules and procedures were drafted which enabled companies to track whether they were implementing the new way of working correctly. However, much of the original intent of the guiding principles was lost in this translation. Unfortunately when teams mechanically follow the process the results are not as good as intended.\n\nIn addition to the implementation issue there is also an expectation issue. Design thinking is widely celebrated as a ‘magic’ method, simply hire a UX designer and they will produce an innovative result to any situation. However, there is no such ‘magic’ one-size-fits-all solution and when the person, team or area fails, the blame falls and the framework rather than poor execution. \n\n###Back to Basics\n\nThe principles behind design thinking are still as relevant as they ever were. An approach of empathy with users is critical in ensuring product market fit for existing and future products. With the resurgence of industrial design and the Internet of Things, we are returning to an era of physical product development where the costs of production are higher than digital making the emphasis on customer needs even more relevant.

The term has gained a lot of attention in a wide range of contexts, and has been embraced by organisations of all stripes - big and small corporations, NGOs and governments alike.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"designthinkinginterest2005present\">Design Thinking Interest: 2005 - Present</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/08/design-thinking.PNG\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"failedexperiment\">‘Failed Experiment’</h3>\n\n<p>With this rapid growth, criticism has also intensified. Bruce Nussbaum, who describes himself as one of design thinking’s biggest supporters, calls it a ‘failed experiment’. Others claim that design thinking has become a ‘buzz phrase’ that is hyped, over-used, and should be dismissed.</p>\n\n<p>Design thinking has been declared <em>dead</em>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dowereallyneeddesignthinking\">Do We Really Need Design Thinking?</h3>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, design thinking is a user-centered way of problem solving that helps businesses (not necessarily working within the design industry) produce outstanding results. “Design thinking has become established as the way to build products, services and experiences with a focus on the people who use them. It’s the way that both startups and large corporations are fusing their work,” says Doug Powell, design principal at IBM. The design thinking process draws upon the logic and imagination of a designer, and encourages multi-disciplinary teams of designers, engineers, marketing, product managers, and many other to collaborate, and explore all possibilities how to reach a result that improves the lives of the users.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, design thinking has produced thousands of success stories. It has helped non-design companies, both small and large, to start thinking in a new way and apply principles of design to foster innovation. Johnson &amp; Johnson, P&amp;G, GE, Uber, and IBM are only few examples of large companies that changed their mindsets and integrated design thinking throughout the entire business. They recognised the potential of design thinking, and found an alternative way to discover new opportunities, uncover issues and catalyse the process of solving problems. Using the mantra of IBM, design thinking helps them reach for ‘smarter teams, better ideas, and happier users’.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"everythingsgreatwhatstheproblem\">Everything’s Great, What’s the Problem?</h3>\n\n<p>If design thinking is delivering success then why are people claiming it should be dismissed or forgotten? The ‘death of design thinking’ lies less with the method itself than with the way it is being implemented. </p>\n\n<p>Design thinking was established as a set of principles that guide how teams should focus more on the end users than on the product itself. However principles are hard to implement. As design thinking was being adopted at a large scale rules and procedures were drafted which enabled companies to track whether they were implementing the new way of working correctly. However, much of the original intent of the guiding principles was lost in this translation. Unfortunately when teams mechanically follow the process the results are not as good as intended.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the implementation issue there is also an expectation issue. Design thinking is widely celebrated as a ‘magic’ method, simply hire a UX designer and they will produce an innovative result to any situation. However, there is no such ‘magic’ one-size-fits-all solution and when the person, team or area fails, the blame falls and the framework rather than poor execution. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"backtobasics\">Back to Basics</h3>\n\n<p>The principles behind design thinking are still as relevant as they ever were. An approach of empathy with users is critical in ensuring product market fit for existing and future products. With the resurgence of industrial design and the Internet of Things, we are returning to an era of physical product development where the costs of production are higher than digital making the emphasis on customer needs even more relevant. Fundamentally, design thinking is a way of thinking - it is about understanding the needs of a customer and delivering the best product for that user. While the rigid framework is dead the principles will continue... </p>\n\n<p><strong>Design Thinking is dead, long live design thinking!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Design Thinking will be featured and discussed in more detail at <a href=\"https://uxdxconf.com/#/\">UXDX</a> in November.

While getting funded is a major achievement for many startups, VC's are not charities - like any business they need to generate more capital than they spend.

This is why small improvements over existing market offerings are rarely funded. \n\nOnce you have your significantly improved, or market making, product the next key area of focus is on barriers to entry. Companies are most vulnerable in the early stages as the market incumbents have the capital and existing market share. Fortunately for entrepreneurs most incumbents don't recognise the niche that the new company is targeting as worthy enough of their attention. This is great during the early stages of a company but it can be a double edged sword when trying to raise capital because the entrepreneur also needs to convince the VC on the size of the market. \n\n##Market\n>*“Great markets make great companies”,*  Don Valentine, founder of Sequoia Capital\n\nWhen you have a market making product it can be very difficult to quantify the size of the potential market. Nonetheless it is very important that you can demonstrate that there is a significant market because, due to the risk inherent in each investment, VC’s are looking for a very high upside to offset their risk. This means that a second essential criteria for an investment is a demonstrated, realistic, large and lucrative market.  \n\n*“We have always focused on the market,*” says Valentine, also known as the ‘grandfather of Silicon Valley venture capital’, *“because our objective always was to build big companies. If you don’t attack a big market, it’s highly unlikely you’re ever going to build a big company.”*\n\n##Team\n>*“We struggle from a distance to evaluate market, and we also actually struggle to evaluate product.”*   Marc Andreessen, Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n![alt](/content/images/2016/09/Team.jpg)\n\nAny successful entrepreneur will tell you, you cannot do it alone; building a strong team is essential. There are many reasons for this from sharing the workload, to maintaining motivation as you struggle with the challenges of the daily grind. \n\nA good team provides a set of complementary skills to enable the distribution of workload but also, equally important is the attitude and connection between the team members. Teams with really deep connections experiment more, generate deeper insights and work together to solve their problems.\n\nAs Ed Catmull, the president of Pixar-Disney and author of the book Creativity, Inc., argues: \n>*“If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up. If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better.”* \n\nMarc Andreessen also comments on another benefit of a strong founding team:\n\n*“If you can get yourself in business with really good people, I think number one: if it works it’s great, because those are really good people to be in business with and they, with you, can build something great. But even if it doesn’t work—if it’s the wrong market or the wrong product—you’ll still learn so much working with the right people and you’ll build such a valuable network for what you do next.”*\n\n##Putting it all together\nEach of the three core areas is required in order for a VC to invest in your business.

To become remembered, design should combine several magic ingredients; pure and distinctive shapes, attractive colours, and ensure that the overall logo being meaningful to the target audience.\n\nOver the past few months, we’ve been working on a logo that would incorporate our message, one that would appeal to our audience of designers and developers, who often have polar opposite views. \n\nIn the spirit of our brand - team collaboration and user experience - we’d like to share our journey with you; from creating brief and different concepts, trials and tribulations, to the final, finished and polished design of our logo.\n\n#Back to the Beginning - The Research\n\nOur logo journey started with our conference idea. We wanted to create a conference that would actually help people navigate the ever changing landscape of best practice product delivery and deliver real benefit to product teams in companies large and small. \n\nWe started out by mapping the key stakeholders when developing a product: **Product Owners, Designers, Developers, Marketers**\n\nWe researched with this audience in three different ways: \n\n####Direct Communication\nThrough attendance of weekly meetups in almost every category, we got to meet our audience, have a beer and find out what makes them tick.\n\n####National Survey\nWe developed a survey to find out individual, team and industry challenges, along with what companies were getting products and teams right.\n\n####Calls with Suppliers\nWhat their thoughts were as “experts” to the industry and what people asked them for help with. \n\n#Challenges and Requirements\nThe following overall industry challenges arose from our findings of our research (we are closing our [survey](https://uxdxconf.com/#/survey) shortly, we will be releasing the full findings in mid October).\n\n###Meeting targets and deadlines\n- Reducing waste in development\n- Streamlining workflow\n\n###Increasing go to market speed\n- Removing handovers and bottlenecks between teams\n- Getting designers and developers to work closer together\n\n###Usability by design\n- User experience best practices\n- Ongoing client interaction & feedback\n- A/B Testing and customer tracking\n\n###Managing ambiguous requirements\n- Lean and agile methodology to shorten the feedback loop\n- Continuous testing and deployment\n\n###Managing increasing deployment frequency\n- DevOps best practice and automation\n- Team scaling through Microservices\n\n###Improving cross team communication\n- Multi-disciplined teams\n- Team bonding and training\n\n###Hiring / nurturing talent\n- Targeted recruitment through exciting projects\n- Paired teams and mentorship\n\n###Managing stakeholders\n- Early and regular product releases\n- Agile implementation \n\n###Non traditional UIs\n- Early adopter case studies. \n- Designer, developer team collaboration\n\n--- \t\t\n#The Birth of UXDX\nIf we were to pick out one theme from our research it is that product delivery is all about the people! In particular we picked out the three areas below which highlight the ways in which product teams must work together to deliver the right product for the user. \n        \n###User Experience (UX)\nWithout a customer, there is no product. A product should always work closely with and focus on the end user to provide a product/solution match. This is the foundation of product development. \n\n###Experience Design (XD)\nExperience Design is the art of simplifying complex interactions into meaningful experiences; designing the product with a focus placed on the quality of the user experience and culturally relevant solutions.\n\n###Developer Experience (DX)\nDX is a relatively underused term, but critical component. Developer Experience is about the aggregate of all the experiences a developer has when interacting with your API. We wanted to highlight the importance of facilitating better user experiences by making app development easier for developers.\n\nWe merged the three areas together and **UXDX** was born.\n\n--- \n\n#Initial Designs\nAs a team, we worked on a brief providing detailed information on what should the new logo look like (emphasising simplicity, memorability, and versatility) and what meanings should be imbued behind it. Above all, we wanted to stress the idea of bringing together people from different roles who typically don’t understand each other.\n\nWe tried not to influence our designer with preferred colours or shapes, and asked for their thoughts instead. After a few weeks our designer presented their first concepts. We’ve summarised them with the brevity they deserve below. \n\n![UXDX 1](/content/images/2016/09/UXDX1.jpg)\n\n>PlayStation / XBox \n<hr>\n![UXDX 2](/content/images/2016/09/UXDX2.jpg)\n>Xerox \n<hr>\n![UXDX 3](/content/images/2016/09/UXDX3.jpg)\n> “We’re not a software company from the 80’s.” \n\nMonika, our Marketing Manager.\n<hr>\n![UXDX 4](/content/images/2016/09/UXDX4.jpg)\n> \"I just see legs when I look at the X's, and I think they need to go to the loo!\"\n\nOur director, Catherine\n<hr>\n![UXDX 5](/content/images/2016/09/UXDX5.jpg)\nOur favourite logo from what was provided \n\n---\n\n#We’re Not Happy… What Now?\n\n>“Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the possibility of failure.”\n\n*Saul Bass, Logo Designer*\n\nWe received several concepts of the UXDX logo, but none of them made us skip a heartbeat. We were missing the versatility and uniqueness, we weren’t sure about the colours and overall, slightly generic design. \n\n## A Fresh Start\nHowever crazy this may sound in the middle of the process, we followed our intuition, and hired a new designer who came as a recommendation. We made sure to do a more thorough vetting of their portfolio given our first experience.\n\nRather than producing a multitude of logos our new designer came back with a single concept and the thinking behind the logo. \n\n![The final logo](/content/images/2016/09/output_FEM58L.gif)\n\nThe icon was designed to represent the idea of ​​the mutual support and collaboration. It was drawn by hand to fit all of the letters of the name X, D, U into one symbolic icon in order to express the equal importance of all the elements that our conference is focused on.\n\nIf you turn the icon 90 degrees clockwise, you can see DC characters linked together, which symbolises the need for cooperation between Designers and Coders while developing a product.\n\nIn addition, the letters together shape an unfinished hourglass icon. This is a symbol of the time dedicated to developing and learning. The unfinished part indicates that we’re not capped, limited or finished with our learning or with our abilities. \n\nFinally, the logo was designed as a monogram, so it can be used in black or white form as well as the colour version.\n\n\n#No Shortcuts, Lot of Learning###\nWe only needed to make a minor revision to this first concept to arrive at our final logo. After all the time spent going the wrong way, we finally got what we had been waiting for - the simple, versatile concept, tailored exactly to our needs.\n\n>“In life there are no shortcuts; process is still the best way to get ahead.” \n\n*Bidemi Mark-Mordi*\n\nAs with any creative process, there were challenges we needed to overcome to get to the final result we’ve been happy with. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts in developing creative ideas, but a lot of learning came up with this journey. Most of all, the 3 key things to remember:\n\n1. Always work as a team\n2. Don’t be afraid of change\n3. Good things come to those who wait\n\nDo you want to share your own experience or thoughts on our new branding?

We wanted to create a conference that would actually help people navigate the ever changing landscape of best practice product delivery and deliver real benefit to product teams in companies large and small. </p>\n\n<p>We started out by mapping the key stakeholders when developing a product: <strong>Product Owners, Designers, Developers, Marketers</strong></p>\n\n<p>We researched with this audience in three different ways: </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"directcommunication\">Direct Communication</h4>\n\n<p>Through attendance of weekly meetups in almost every category, we got to meet our audience, have a beer and find out what makes them tick.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"nationalsurvey\">National Survey</h4>\n\n<p>We developed a survey to find out individual, team and industry challenges, along with what companies were getting products and teams right.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"callswithsuppliers\">Calls with Suppliers</h4>\n\n<p>What their thoughts were as “experts” to the industry and what people asked them for help with. </p>\n\n<h1 id=\"challengesandrequirements\">Challenges and Requirements</h1>\n\n<p>The following overall industry challenges arose from our findings of our research (we are closing our <a href=\"https://uxdxconf.com/#/survey\">survey</a> shortly, we will be releasing the full findings in mid October).</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"meetingtargetsanddeadlines\">Meeting targets and deadlines</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing waste in development</li>\n<li>Streamlining workflow</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"increasinggotomarketspeed\">Increasing go to market speed</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Removing handovers and bottlenecks between teams</li>\n<li>Getting designers and developers to work closer together</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"usabilitybydesign\">Usability by design</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>User experience best practices</li>\n<li>Ongoing client interaction &amp; feedback</li>\n<li>A/B Testing and customer tracking</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"managingambiguousrequirements\">Managing ambiguous requirements</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lean and agile methodology to shorten the feedback loop</li>\n<li>Continuous testing and deployment</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"managingincreasingdeploymentfrequency\">Managing increasing deployment frequency</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>DevOps best practice and automation</li>\n<li>Team scaling through Microservices</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"improvingcrossteamcommunication\">Improving cross team communication</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Multi-disciplined teams</li>\n<li>Team bonding and training</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"hiringnurturingtalent\">Hiring / nurturing talent</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Targeted recruitment through exciting projects</li>\n<li>Paired teams and mentorship</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"managingstakeholders\">Managing stakeholders</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Early and regular product releases</li>\n<li>Agile implementation </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"nontraditionaluis\">Non traditional UIs</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Early adopter case studies. </li>\n<li>Designer, developer team collaboration</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"thebirthofuxdx\">The Birth of UXDX</h1>\n\n<p>If we were to pick out one theme from our research it is that product delivery is all about the people! In particular we picked out the three areas below which highlight the ways in which product teams must work together to deliver the right product for the user. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"userexperienceux\">User Experience (UX)</h3>\n\n<p>Without a customer, there is no product. A product should always work closely with and focus on the end user to provide a product/solution match. This is the foundation of product development. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"experiencedesignxd\">Experience Design (XD)</h3>\n\n<p>Experience Design is the art of simplifying complex interactions into meaningful experiences; designing the product with a focus placed on the quality of the user experience and culturally relevant solutions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"developerexperiencedx\">Developer Experience (DX)</h3>\n\n<p>DX is a relatively underused term, but critical component. Developer Experience is about the aggregate of all the experiences a developer has when interacting with your API. We wanted to highlight the importance of facilitating better user experiences by making app development easier for developers.</p>\n\n<p>We merged the three areas together and <strong>UXDX</strong> was born.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"initialdesigns\">Initial Designs</h1>\n\n<p>As a team, we worked on a brief providing detailed information on what should the new logo look like (emphasising simplicity, memorability, and versatility) and what meanings should be imbued behind it. Above all, we wanted to stress the idea of bringing together people from different roles who typically don’t understand each other.</p>\n\n<p>We tried not to influence our designer with preferred colours or shapes, and asked for their thoughts instead. After a few weeks our designer presented their first concepts. We’ve summarised them with the brevity they deserve below. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/09/UXDX1.jpg\" alt=\"UXDX 1\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>PlayStation / XBox </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>  \n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/09/UXDX2.jpg\" alt=\"UXDX 2\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Xerox </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>  \n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/09/UXDX3.jpg\" alt=\"UXDX 3\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“We’re not a software company from the 80’s.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Monika, our Marketing Manager.  </p>\n\n<hr>  \n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/09/UXDX4.jpg\" alt=\"UXDX 4\" /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I just see legs when I look at the X's, and I think they need to go to the loo!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our director, Catherine  </p>\n\n<hr>  \n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/09/UXDX5.jpg\" alt=\"UXDX 5\" />\nOur favourite logo from what was provided </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"werenothappywhatnow\">We’re Not Happy… What Now?</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the possibility of failure.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Saul Bass, Logo Designer</em></p>\n\n<p>We received several concepts of the UXDX logo, but none of them made us skip a heartbeat. We were missing the versatility and uniqueness, we weren’t sure about the colours and overall, slightly generic design. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"afreshstart\">A Fresh Start</h2>\n\n<p>However crazy this may sound in the middle of the process, we followed our intuition, and hired a new designer who came as a recommendation. We made sure to do a more thorough vetting of their portfolio given our first experience.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than producing a multitude of logos our new designer came back with a single concept and the thinking behind the logo. </p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2016/09/output_FEM58L.gif\" alt=\"The final logo\" /></p>\n\n<p>The icon was designed to represent the idea of ​​the mutual support and collaboration. It was drawn by hand to fit all of the letters of the name X, D, U into one symbolic icon in order to express the equal importance of all the elements that our conference is focused on.</p>\n\n<p>If you turn the icon 90 degrees clockwise, you can see DC characters linked together, which symbolises the need for cooperation between Designers and Coders while developing a product.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the letters together shape an unfinished hourglass icon. This is a symbol of the time dedicated to developing and learning. The unfinished part indicates that we’re not capped, limited or finished with our learning or with our abilities. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, the logo was designed as a monogram, so it can be used in black or white form as well as the colour version.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"noshortcutslotoflearning\">No Shortcuts, Lot of Learning</h1>\n\n<p>We only needed to make a minor revision to this first concept to arrive at our final logo. After all the time spent going the wrong way, we finally got what we had been waiting for - the simple, versatile concept, tailored exactly to our needs.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“In life there are no shortcuts; process is still the best way to get ahead.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Bidemi Mark-Mordi</em></p>\n\n<p>As with any creative process, there were challenges we needed to overcome to get to the final result we’ve been happy with. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts in developing creative ideas, but a lot of learning came up with this journey. Most of all, the 3 key things to remember:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Always work as a team  </li>\n<li>Don’t be afraid of change  </li>\n<li>Good things come to those who wait</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Do you want to share your own experience or thoughts on our new branding?
