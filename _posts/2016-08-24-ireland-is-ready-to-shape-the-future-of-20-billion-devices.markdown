The Internet of Things is one of the fastest-growing areas of the tech industry and has the potential to dramatically improve the way we live, work, and interact with one another. From 2 billion objects in 2006, IoT connected devices are expected to grow to a breathtaking 200 billion by 2020. That means around 26 smart objects for every human being on the planet! Are you ready for this dramatic transformation?

## From Smart Gadgets to Smart Cities

Our homes and cities are slowly but surely filling up with smart gadgets that make our control over our surroundings stronger and more precise. From smart devices we use every day - innovative home appliances, to robotic devices, driverless cars and smart buildings - virtually every aspect of our lives is being impacted by the increasing connectivity around us. What seemed to be a science fiction a few years ago, is now literally at our fingertips.  Welcome to the beginning of the next industrial revolution.

## Ireland – Home for the IoT

If we say Ireland is close to the big IoT revolution, we actually mean that we are closer than anyone else. Several leading companies have already put their trust in Ireland's momentum, expecting to turn the IoT market into a reality. Intel, for example, has recently launched their [The Ignition Labs](http://www.intel.ie/content/www/ie/en/internet-of-things/iot-ignition-labs.html), where they collaborate with local companies to develop technologies for the IoT marketplace. The focus areas of the Ignition Labs are smart homes and buildings, smart cities, smart cars, energy and utilities and smart agriculture.

## Intel as the IoT Game-changer

Although Intel faces strong competition from ARM, Qualcomm, Samsung and others, the draw of a market of 20 billion devices needing computer chips means they are investing heavily in IoT. According to Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel
>“The work we do at Intel today will change this company, our industry and the world.” 

Given the variable size of IoT devices there is a need for a full system on a chip (SoC) implementation so that anything, from a washing machine right down to the clothes on your back, can be turned into a smart device. But small size does not mean low performance. Intel's recently announced [Joule](https://newsroom.intel.com/chip-shots/make-amazing-things-happen-iot-entrepreneurship-intel-joule/) SoC boasts impressive stats for such a small package. The lower end model includes 1.5GHz quad-core Atom processor, 3GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, 802.11AC wireless, Intel graphics with 4K capture and display support, and a Linux-based OS.

## IoT, Intel & UXDX

The Internet of Things represents a new category of product which will lead to a new ecosystem of support products. To get an inside view of the innovations happening in this space, and how you can get in on the ground early, UXDX  has invited **David Boundy**, **Director of IoT** at **Intel** to share his insights into the industry. 

Don’t miss this great opportunity and join us on November 2nd to hear more about David's thoughts and Intel's plans for our future. Early Bird Tickets for the conference are already [available online](https://uxdxconf.com/#/tickets).
