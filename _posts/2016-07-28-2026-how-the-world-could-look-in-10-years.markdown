Just a few days ago, The Verge published an interesting in-depth [interview with Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.theverge.com/a/mark-zuckerberg-future-of-facebook), who announced Facebook’s groundbreaking plans for the next 10 years. That leads us to question; what else is waiting for us in 2026? How will the world look in a decade from now? Which products and technologies will infiltrate our everyday life? 
Get a cup of coffee, sit back, and take a journey to the future with our bold predictions:

## The World of Driverless Cars

“I consider autonomous driving to be a basically solved problem,” said Elon Musk in one of his recent interviews. However crazy this may sound, his prediction of vehicle autonomy is becoming a reality sooner than we think. Volkswagen expects their first self driving cars on the market by 2019, Ford in 2020 and BMW by 2021. At the Frankfurt Auto show last month, US secretary of transportation [Anthony Foxx said](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34475031) he expects driverless cars to be in use all over the world in 10 years. Meaning in 10 years from now we will be in the process of phasing out human driven cars. 

## Getting Everywhere in Few Minutes

For decades, we’ve been trying to eliminate barriers of time and distance. With technology moving forward so quickly, we are very close to a super-fast and super-efficient transportation system which will be capable of whisking passengers between cities (and even nations) just in few minutes. Let’s all cross our fingers and hope that Hyperloop is not only a science fiction, but rather a real part of our future.

## Expanding our Reality

There is nothing we could agree more with Mark Zuckerberg than with the idea of being able to expand our reality even more than today. In ten years from now, virtual reality will fool all of our senses, and bring us into truly immersive experiences. Augmented reality is expected to span numerous sectors, from healthcare, architecture, design, e-commerce, tourism to education. The potential possibilities and business opportunities of VR and AR are literally endless. A completely different world will be in the palm of our hands.

## Internet Access Everywhere

Very ambitious plan (but definitely worthy of respect) is to make the internet accessible to everyone. In 10 years Billions of people will get online thanks to projects like [Google’s ‘Project Loon’](https://www.google.com/loon) based on high-altitude balloons or [Facebook’s ‘Aquila’](https://code.facebook.com/posts/993520160679028/building-communications-networks-in-the-stratosphere/) project with drones. This will finally see the rise of developing nations, remote regions and those suppressed by war and bureaucracy. Hooray for the internet everywhere!

## 3D Printing of Everything

3D printing technology continues to grow and promises to revolutionise many industry sectors. In the advanced stages of this remarkable technology we should be able to print almost anything we can imagine – houses, cars, devices, clothes, furniture, planes, spacecrafts, or even artificial human organs.

## Aerial Drone Services

With a great hype of drones today, we can be sure about their presence in the future. With an industry estimated by [PwC](http://fortune.com/2016/05/09/here-comes-the-latest-drone-army/) as being worth over 127 billion, drones can be a game-changer for businesses, governments and even individuals. Whether it be for delivery services to remote surveillance, in ten years from now, there will be more man-made items in the sky than birds.

## The Collision of Humans and Robots

If we have robots which can serve you food or clean your house now, there is no doubt about robots assisting us in our future everyday life. Moreover, robotic systems are merging with parts of our bodies, so we’ve already started down the path towards a cyborg future. However, there is no need to be scared. Great inventions like robotic limbs or exoskeleton will positively affect lives of thousands of people with disabilities and injuries.

## People on Mars

The latest and boldest of our predictions (you’d better finish your coffee now). Are you one of those who thought, “this is very far fetched,” when watching a movie Martian? Well, you might have been wrong. Elon Musk is also driving this futuristic effort as he edges closer to his life-long dream of colonising another planet as SpaceX’s mission [‘Red Dragon’](http://www.space.com/32718-spacex-red-dragon-private-mars-missions-pictures.html) is planned – it should depart Earth in 2024, and arrive on Mars in 2025. So even it sounds unbelievable now, in ten years we will finally get to understand what our parents generation experienced when Apollo 11 landed on the moon.
