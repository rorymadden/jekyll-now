You’ve built a great site in AngularJS. You like your code, the app’s functionality and design.

However, when it comes to search engines, you may face a problem – your site is rendered and indexed only partially, or not at all. Does it mean that people will never find you on Google? Do you need to completely rebuild your website? Was choosing Angular as a framework a bad decision to make? Mohammed Malaka answered all of these questions in his talk at Angular Dublin Meetup.

### First Things First – Why Is SEO so Important?

Did you know that 93% of all buying decisions start with an online search? That’s quite enough to think about whether your site appears in search engine results or not. Some people say that if you can’t be found on Google, you probably don’t even exist. SEO increases your chances of being visible when customers search for a product or service like yours. It’s one of the most efficient ways for building awareness of your business and bringing more traffic to your website.

### How to Get Google to Crawl Your Site

Mohammed Malaka provides an example of SureSupply, where his team had to find out how to be crawled by search engines, without rebuilding the site. If you struggle with the same issue, get a bit of inspiration of how they did it in 4 steps:

* *Used ‘Fetch as Google’ tool*
* *Added SiteMap to the website*
* *Said no to clean design*
* *Improved keywords (page title & descriptions)*

Results in the first month? 5000 clicks & 100k impressions! If you still think Angular and SEO are enemies that can’t work together, maybe the video below will change your mind.
