Dublin has an underground movement of amazing people that get very little recognition for their contribution, and yet are vital to the success of the Dublin tech scene. Everyday people who are donating their time to help improve knowledge sharing and networking opportunities that are vital for the success and growth of a tech scene. While we could have collated a list about ten times as long we've had to limit our list to 40 key people for brevity’s sake. Let us know in the comments who we are missing and we will continue to update this list as a thank you to the unsung heroes. Aside from some loose groupings of Development, Design, Entrepreneurship and Support the people are listed below in no particular order. 


# Entrepreneurship
### Silviu Preoteasa - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Entrepreneurs-Anonymous-Dublin/" target="_blank">*Entrepreneurs Anonymous*</a>

Since 2014, Silviu has been a chairman of Entrepreneurs Anonymous - the most active meetup group about entrepreneurship in Dublin. Recently, Silviu has become a co-organiser of a popular event, the B.U.I.L.D Hackathon, where technically-minded developers and business people come together to test new ideas and solve challenges. Self described as a growth hacker, serial entrepreneur, and lead investor, while not organising free entrepreneur events Silviu spends his time managing marketing technology in Hostelworld.

Kevin has been running the Hackers/Founders meetup in Dublin which boasts over 2,000 members. Previously he was also at the helm of the Find a Founder meetup which aimed to pair up budding entrepreneurs - because, as we all know, you can’t do it alone. Kevin practices what he preaches as he is a founder of Chainsmiths - a cryptocurrency and blockchain consultancy. On top of all of that Kevin organises the biggest blockchain hackathon in Europe.

## Data Science / NoSQL

### Allen Thomas Varghese - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DataScientistsIreland/" target="_blank">*Data Scientists Ireland*</a>
<img src="http://s21.postimg.org/3sqzopu5f/Allen_Thomas_Varghese.jpg" class="profile-picture-article" alt="Allen Thomas Varghese">

Allen runs both the Data Scientists Ireland and the Dublin Data Science Beginners meetups. By running both meetups Allen enables both experienced developers and interested beginners to learn more and increase their skills in the hottest job title around these days: data science. The sessions cover all things R and Python as well as other data science, statistical computing, data analytics and big data technologies.

### Eoin Brazil, Ger Hartnett, Joe Drumgoole - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DublinMUG/" target="_blank">*MongoDB*</a>
<img src="http://s21.postimg.org/kn5dlsctf/Eoin_Brazil.jpg" class="profile-picture-article" alt="Eoin Brazil"> <img src="http://s21.postimg.org/3p6czy3fn/Gerard_HArtnett.jpg" class="profile-picture-article" alt="Ger Hartnett"> <img src="http://s21.postimg.org/auy42ecir/Joe_Drumgoole.jpg" class="profile-picture-article" alt="Joe Drumgoole">

The MongoDB meetup reflects the growth and popularity of the database itself. Early sessions were introductions to dynamic schemas and document oriented databases but recent talks are more about the challenges in scaling Mongo and multi tenant deployments. Eoin, Ger and Joe obviously believe in the database but they may be a little biased since they all work at MongoDB. However there is no denying that the database has a lot of traction, particularly in the startup world. One way to show how highly regarded it is as a database is that it is the default database for all of the latest development stacks - MEAN, MERN, MEEN among others.

In a very short time Docker has ascended from unknown project to DevOps utility. With more and more people looking to learn about containerisation in all its forms the Dublin Docker meetup aims to meet this demand. The goal is to help people learn about the tools to automate workflows and ship faster. While not supporting Docker Dublin, Dave is a software development manager at Workday and Thomas is a build engineer at Demonware.

Niall setup the Azure Dublin meetup as a place for developers, architects, DevOps, data scientists and IT professionals of all types to meetup and discuss the benefits of Microsoft’s offering in the cloud infrastructure space. The meetup also follows Redmond’s new, more inclusive approach by reaching out to Linux lovers as well as non traditional Microsoft languages such as PHP, Java and Node.js. And Niall is well placed to run the meetup as he works as a principal solutions architect at Microsoft.

Richard believes so much in microservices he’s written a book about it, The Tao of Microservices. According to Richard microservices just make sense - if you can write a system that has scaling for free and it is easier to write in the first place why wouldn’t everyone do it? And with the Dublin Microservices meetup Richard is on a mission to spread the word about this new architecture and help people overcome some of the challenges encountered in moving to a distributed architecture. Richard is a co-founder of the node.js consultancy nearForm and author of numerous open source node.js microservices libraries including Seneca.js.

## Frameworks / Platforms / Libraries
### Xavier Glab, Simona Cotin, Tasos Piotopoulos, Juliusz Fedyk - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AngularJSDublin/" target="_blank">*Angular JS*</a>
<img src="http://s21.postimg.org/wqjw0u2n7/Xavier_Glab.jpg" class="profile-picture-article" alt="Xavier Glab"> <img src="http://s21.postimg.org/c2l8m3her/Simona_Cotin.jpg" class="profile-picture-article" alt="Simona Cotin"> <img src="http://s21.postimg.org/o5qk9nsgz/Tasos.jpg" class="profile-picture-article" alt="Tasos Piotopoulos"> <img src="http://s21.postimg.org/5kt5b3s9v/Juliusz_Fedyk.jpg" class="profile-picture-article" alt="Juliusz Fedyk"> 

Angular burst onto the client side JavaScript framework scene back in 2012 and is now one of the most common frameworks for building single page applications. With the recent release of Angular 2 there is a lot to learn in the angular space. Xavier is a front end developer at Newswhip. Simona works at Corvill and also drives the popular Angular EatUp dinner get togethers for people interested in Angular. Tasos works at Oneview Healthcare and Juliusz works at Accenture.

### Cian O'Maidin - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Node-js-Meetup/" target="_blank">*Dublin Node.js*</a>
<img src="http://s21.postimg.org/msv32jqw3/Cian_OMaidin.jpg" class="profile-picture-article" alt="Cian O'Maidin">

When NodeJs was a plaything for mad scientists Cian and his business partner Richard Rodger went all in. They saw the potential in the nascent platform and setup a node.js consultancy, nearForm, which has grown to become the largest node.js specialist consultancy in the world. From day one Cian has supported the node.js community in Ireland through the Dublin Node.js meetup but he also organises the annual NodeConf.eu event. Even though Cian is based in Waterford we included him in the Dublin list due to the work he does in the big smoke.

### Rob Campion, Cian MacMahon - <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ReactJS-Dublin/" target="_blank">*ReactJS*</a>

The ReactJS meetup, just like its namesake library is a fairly new entrant onto the scene but it is gaining a lot of popularity. React was a pioneer in the virtual DOM space which offered a much higher performance option for web applications with many data bound objects. The complementary Flux architecture pattern espoused the benefits of a unidirectional flow of data based on the belief that "shared mutable state is the root of all evil". Both Rob and Cian work as software engineers at Hubspot where they are putting React through its paces in production code.

Girl Geek Dinners are a chance for ladies in technology to get together, enjoy some nice food and drinks, and have fun meeting other women in their field. Originally started in London, Christina brought Geek Girls to Dublin to highlight the growing number of women in tech in Ireland as well as provide a social and support network. While it is a Girl Geek event it is not exclusive and members may invite their male friends. Christina also supports the Women Who Code Dublin meetup as well. When not supporting meetups Christina works as a Technical Support Engineer at Microsoft.

Silicon Drinkabout is a monthly meetup for startups (including techies, designers and business folk) to meet like-minded people, have some fun and relax at the end of the working week. As startups are often working solo, getting out of the office (home) can be very helpful. Gene has been helping out in the startup and tech community for years through his involvement in numerous startup weekends, co-founding Startup Ireland and now through his role as Entrepreneur in Residence at Bank of Ireland.
